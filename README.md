# WebRTC Video and MIDI Streaming
WebRTC video plus MIDI streaming

This is a simple implementation based on [serverless-webrtc] (https://github.com/cjb/serverless-webrtc) with added MIDI streaming. It uses Firebase for signal exchange. It's a work in progress.

This will not work in two different browser tabs. You need two devices. Notice that MIDI streaming will only Chrome 50+ (Firefox does not yet implement Web MIDI API).
